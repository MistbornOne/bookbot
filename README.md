# BookBot README

## What is BookBot?

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!  I am on the path to becoming a developer and wanted to share this project with the world.


BookBot is a shell program that functions by using command line arguments to read and analyze files in the path you specify.


Feel free to clone the repo and use on your local machine!


## How to Use BookBot:

Below is an example of how to use the program once you have it downloaded:

    1. Navigate to the correct directory where you store the BookBot Program

	cd <your_directory_path>

    2. Use the following code to call the program:
	
	python3 main.py <your_file_path> #Ex filepath = books/frankenstein.txt


    3. You should receive a readout report that looks like the following:
