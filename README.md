## What is BookBot?

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!


BookBot functions by using command line arguments to read and analyze files in the path you specify.


Feel free to clone the repo and use on your local machine!

## How to Use BookBot:

Below is an example of how to use the program once you have it downloaded:

#Navigate to the correct directory where you store the BookBot Program

	#cd <your_directory_path>

#Use the following code to call the program:
	
	#python3 main.py <your_file_path> #Ex filepath = books/frankenstein.txt


#You should receive a readout report that looks like the following:
